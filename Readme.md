# Watchy OS (WOS)

I'm currently woring on WatchyOS (WOS) - its an alternative to the official
Watchy code. Instead on heavly relying on inheritance, this project is structured
by different components which are controlled by a kernel. This should provide
more flexibility and it should become easier for developers to add new
features.

More updates are comming soon.
